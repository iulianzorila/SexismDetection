# Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
Sexism is a form of discrimination based on a personâ€™s gender or sex. Sexism can lead to violence and creates an oppressive environment that prevents most women from fully participating in public life. Creating a model that is able to identify sexist texts could lead to several positive outcomes for society. Such a model could be used to prevent and counter sexist language in different situations, such as in public and private communications, media, and social networks. This could help promote gender equality and create a more inclusive and respectful environment.

In our project we focused solely on identifying signs of sexism and classifying them. In particular we complited 3 different tasks: 

*  **Task A** - Binary Sexism Detection: a two-class (or binary) classification where systems have to predict whether a post is sexist or not sexist.
*  **Task B** - Category of Sexism: for posts which are sexist, a four-class classification where systems have to predict one of four categories: (1) threats, (2)  derogation, (3) animosity, (4) prejudiced discussion. 
*  **Task C** - Fine-grained Vector of Sexism: for posts which are sexist, an 11-class classification where systems have to predict one of 11 fine-grained vectors.

The problem at hand was taken from SemEval-2023 Task 10: Explainable Detection of Online Sexism.
